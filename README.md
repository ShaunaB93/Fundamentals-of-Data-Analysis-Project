# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project
Project assignment about box plots, demonstrated in python and discussing background of the plots in a jupyter notebook


## Contents of the repository -

This repository contains a notebook used to outline the background information, uses, terminology and comparison of box plots to the alternate options available.

The four main objectives of this analysis were to complete the following - 

1. Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used.

2. Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing.

3. Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile.

4. Compare the box plot to alternatives.

To meet the above objectives the notebook contains information on the history of box plots, the uses for such plots, related terminology and comparisons of box plots to some alternate options available.

## How to run the notebook -

To run, edit and view this notebook the download option can be used on the dashboard view for this repository. This will download a zip file containing the notebook and files related to this assignment. 

In order to use this notebook it is required to have the correct packages installed which allow jupyter notebook to be utilised on the machine being used to view this file. The most popular way to install this, and multiple other useful packages, is through the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). *[1]*

Once the relevant file has been downloaded locally to your machine, and you have installed the packages required to utilise jupyter notebooks, the command jupyter notebook can be ran through any command line interface which you may have installed. This can be ran from your home folder or by using the "cd" command to the folder in which you have downloaded the notebooks files. This will lead to a pop up window of Jupyter notebook to be opened and a list of files in the folder you have ran this command from should appear. Following this you will need to locate the notebook file on your machine using the file structure in Jupyter notebook.

Once the file has been opened the Cell, run all, commands can be used to re-run any code cells to view the results etc. The various functions which can be used in the jupyter notebooks to view, edit and run the cells, text or code, can be found on their website [here](http://jupyter.org/) or through the various cheat sheets available online. *[2]*
